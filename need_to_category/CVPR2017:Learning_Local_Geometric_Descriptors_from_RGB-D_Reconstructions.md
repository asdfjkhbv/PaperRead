# Paper TITLE: 3DMatch: Learning Local Geometric Descriptors from RGB-D Reconstructions

## Abstract INFO
        
        first the method extract geometric features(is that Geometric invariance Feature?) 
        real-world depth image characters: nosiy, low-resolution, incomplete nature of 3D data.
        3DMatch : a data-driven model
        useful in ： * instance-level object model alignment for the Amazon Picking Challange.
## Introduction INFO
        Matching 3D geometry application: object pse estimation object retrieval, 3D reconstruction and camera localization.
