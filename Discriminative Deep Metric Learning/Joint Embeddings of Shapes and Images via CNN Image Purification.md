# Paper Title: Joint Embeddings of Shapes and Images via CNN Image Purification

> HighLight construct 3D shapes and 2D image embedding space

## Embedding space construction

1. use the image set of 3D shape to represent 3D shapes globally and locally.
2. Shape distance metric is based on the principles of the Light-Field Descriptor.
