Abstract
    The use of the Automation of abnormal human behavior analysis can be categorized
into two classes
        1. Decrease the time of surveillance system which is used to store the activities
           that happened in the application context.
        2. Automatic summarize content of the objects that is tracking and recognizing
    AND the semantics can extend surveillance systems to perform event-based behavior
analysis relevant to the domain.
1. INTRODUCTION
    Three usage of the surveillance systems
    1. Video surveillance acts as a security mechanism
    2. This paper give an surveillance systems to monitor children and old people.
    ---(Liao S-K, Liu B-Y (2010) An edge-based approach to improve optical flow algorithm.)
    3. Pattern analysis where people behavior and shoppers' buying behavior are
    collected and patterns found.
    ---(Leykin A, Tuceryan M (2007) Detecting shopper groups in video sequences.)
    Cameras is the eye of the surveillance system of surveillance system. Camera's
    placement play a vital role in handling occlusion.
    The basic steps involved in processing a video are
    1）video segmentation,
    2）Motion detection (background modeling, foreground segmentation),
    3）object classification,
    4）motion tracking and finally,
    5）activity recognition
    The five elements is shown in Fig. 1.
    To make a machine to watch videos , the videos should be handled by the
    following steps.
    Firstly, split video into a sequence of images(frames) .
    Secondly, use the motion detecting technique to find the moving objects.
        IN THIS STEP, motion detecting include {
                                                  background modeling,
          (extract background image from a sequence of frames)
                                                  foreground modeling
          (segment out a noisy image with moving objects in it)
                                                  and foreground processing
          (remove noise from the result oft the previous )
                                                  }
    AFTER motion detection, the video handling enter the step of OBJECT CLASSIFICATION
    --(object classification).
    IN THIS SECTION, the blob in the foreground is categorized into object types.
    motion tracking (motion detection & object classification & motion tracking ) produce
    useful results for human behavior analysis.
    The types of behaviors that can be analyzed are represented in
    Fig.2:Categorization of human behaviors.
