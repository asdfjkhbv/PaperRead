Abstract
    The use of the Automation of abnormal human behavior analysis can be categorized
into two classes
        1. Decrease the time of surveillance system which is used to store the activities
           that happened in the application context.
        2. Automatic summarize content of the objects that is tracking and recognizing
    AND the semantics can extend surveillance systems to perform event-based behavior
analysis relevant to the domain.
1. INTRODUCTION
    Three usage of the surveillance systems
    1. Video surveillance acts as a security mechanism
    2. This paper give an surveillance systems to monitor children and old people.
    ---(Liao S-K, Liu B-Y (2010) An edge-based approach to improve optical flow algorithm.)
    3. Pattern analysis where people behavior and shoppers' buying behavior are
    collected and patterns found.
    ---(Leykin A, Tuceryan M (2007) Detecting shopper groups in video sequences.)
    Cameras is the eye of the surveillance system of surveillance system. Camera's
    placement play a vital role in handling occlusion.
    The basic steps involved in processing a video are
    1）video segmentation,
    2）Motion detection (background modeling, foreground segmentation),
    3）object classification,
    4）motion tracking and finally,
    5）activity recognition
    The five elements is shown in Fig. 1.
