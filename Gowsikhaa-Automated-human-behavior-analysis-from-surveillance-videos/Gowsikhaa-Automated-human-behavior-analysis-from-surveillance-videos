Abstract
    The use of the Automation of abnormal human behavior analysis can be categorized into two classes
        1. Decrease the time of surveillance system which is used to store the activities that happened in the application context.
        2. Automatic summarize content of the objects that is tracking and recognizing
    AND the semantics can extend surveillance systems to perform event-based behavior analysis relevant to the domain.
1. INTRODUCTION
    Three usage of the surveillance systems
    1. Video surveillance acts as a security mechanism
    2. This paper give an surveillance systems to monitor children and old people.
    ---[Liao S-K, Liu B-Y (2010) An edge-based approach to improve optical flow algorithm.]
    3. Pattern analysis where people behavior and shoppers' buying behavior are
    collected and patterns found.
    ---[Leykin A, Tuceryan M (2007) Detecting shopper groups in video sequences.]
    Cameras is the eye of the surveillance system of surveillance system. Camera's placement play a vital role in handling occlusion.
    The basic steps involved in processing a video are
    1）video segmentation,
    2）Motion detection (background modeling, foreground segmentation),
    3）object classification,
    4）motion tracking and finally,
    5）activity recognition
    The five elements is shown in Fig. 1.
    To make a machine to watch videos , the videos should be handled by the
    following steps.
    Firstly, split video into a sequence of images(frames). Secondly, use the motion detecting technique to find the moving objects.
        IN THIS STEP, motion detecting include {
                                                  background modeling,
          (extract background image from a sequence of frames)
                                                  foreground modeling
          (segment out a noisy image with moving objects in it)
                                                  and foreground processing
          (remove noise from the result oft the previous )
                                                  }
    AFTER motion detection, the video handling enter the step of OBJECT CLASSIFICATION
    --(object classification).
    IN THIS SECTION, the blob in the foreground is categorized into object types.
    motion tracking (motion detection & object classification & motion tracking ) produce
    useful results for human behavior analysis.
    The types of behaviors that can be analyzed are represented in
    Fig.2:Categorization of human behaviors.
2. Low-level processing techniques
    This section introduce the techniques that don't require semantics and just
    give the objects in order that next step can use.
    Low-level technique {
                          background modeling,
                          foreground detection,
                          object classification,
                          simple motion tracking
                        }
    2.1 Motion detecting methods
        The methods can only segment out the moving objects from origin images.
        In this part, "the required moving objects" == "foreground";
                      "the unwanted background information" == "background"
        Background Modeling can use techniques {
                    medium complexity techniques: approximate mean & approximate median
                    low complexity techniques: first input image is background
                    another: treat the previous frame as the current image background
                            }
        Foreground Modeling $$$ {
                                background subtraction;
                                temporal differencing;
                                optical flows
                                }
        Background subtraction :
        Most Frequently used:
        1)[Javed O, Shafique K, Shah M (2002) A hierarchical approach to robust background subtraction using color and gradient information.]
        2)[McIvor AM (1999) Background subtraction techniques.]
        3)[Li W, Zhang Z, Liu Z (2010) Action recognition based on a bag of 3D points. ]
        Simple Background Subtraction works for static background.
        Adaptive Background Subtraction use of dynamic background update.
        ADVANTAGEs: robust to changing background & environmental conditions.
        DISADVANTAGEs: consumes much memory for storing intermediate valuse.
        SOLUTIONs: adding scene classification module
        ---[Biologically inspired features for scene classification in video surveillance.]
        Temporal Differencing:
        PRINCIPLE: the pixel-wise difference(逐像素差异) between two or three consecutive image to extract moving objects.
        Most Frequently used:
        [Mahadevan V, Vasconcelos N (2009) Segmentation of motion objects from surveillance video sequences using temporal differencing combined with       multiple correlation.]
        DISADVANTAGEs: It is poor in extracting all relevant pixels.
                       It may be lead the cavities left inside moving entities. (only happen when the object moving slowly or it has uniform textures.)
        SOLUTIONs: adding filtering algorithms.
        ---[Xiaofeng L, Tao Z, Zaiwen L (2010) A novel method on moving-objects detection based on background subtraction and three frames differencing. ] (Three frame differencing image is used instead of using the current frame directly.)
        Optical Flow:
        It depends on the distribution of apparent velocities of movements of brightness patterns in an image and gives information about arrangement of objects viewed.
        Usage: computationally complex for complex dynamic image analysis.
    2.2 Object classification methods
        Object classification can classified and labelled. The accuracy of classification rely on the features that motion detection technique   extracted.
        This section often use advanced Machine Learning algorithm (such as Neural Networks). Objects' feature can be shape, type of motion.
        Templates matching is a frequently method for classification. The objects extracted by the foreground image will be compared with a set of templates and it will be measured by similarity measures. If the template and the object in fore ground match or are similar , the appropriate object type is said to have been found.
        Object classification can be done either after or before background subtraction [Ogale NA (2006) A survey of techniques for human detection from video].
        If we want classify an object directly from the video input, we should use edge detection algorithms to find out the edges of the current frame and then separate the moving part from it through background subtraction.
        Two important categorizations of object classification algorithms are
        {
                  Motion-based classification methods :
                  (needs any motion based parameter---[Yoshimitsu Y, Naito T, Fujimura K, Kamijo S (2010) Behavior understanding at railway station by association of locational semantics and postures. ]);
                  Shape-based classification methods :
                  (uses the features that best represent the object's shape for classification.---[Lao W, Han J, deWith PHN (2010) Flexible human behavior analysis framework for video surveillance applications.])
        }
        Contours Shape is important for classify a human and a non-human. And the Contour Shape Features can be obtained by two ways:
        {
          neighbor masking algorithm
          (used after motion detection.)
          ---[Liao S-K, Liu B-Y (2010) An edge-based approach to improve optical flow algorithm.]
          edge masking algorithm
          (directly from the input frame)
          ---[Tabb K, Davey N, Adams R, George S (2004) Detecting, tracking & classifying human movement using active contour models and neural networks.]
        }

        When choosing shape control points from a contour, normalization can be done. Two ways can improve the system.{
          Normalization
           can scales up the distances as well as the number of contour points. So, this method can adapt itself for grownups as well as children.



        } The choice of a pre-defined number of coordinates results in uniformity of the features. [Rougier C, Meunier J, St-Arnaud A, Rousseau J (2011) Robust video surveillance for fall detection based on human shape deformation.]uses a combination of the two methods mentioned above to get a better result. Here the foreground silhouette is combined with the canny edge image.
   2.3 Motion Tracking Methods
        Motion Tracking is about to find out the temporary consistency of the moving object and to recognize the new object is or not that has been previously seen. It can use  {
                                        region-based method;
                  {
                  considers variation in the image regions corresponding to the moving objects.---[Brox T, Rosenhahn B, Gall J, Cremers D (2010) Combined region and motion-based 3D tracking of rigid and articulated objects.]
                  }
                                        feature-based method;
                  {
                  A feature-based technique extracts features from a person and uses them to track the body parts in the subsequent frames.---[Park S, Aggarwal JK (2004) Semantic-level understanding of human actions and interactions using event hierarchy. ] & [Chen Y-K, Lin Y-T, Kung SY (1996) A feature tracking algorithm using neighborhood relaxation with multi-candidate pre-screening.]
                  }
                                    contour-based method;
                  {
                   tracks only the contour of the object instead of the whole object.
                   ---[Techmer A (2001) Contour-based motion estimation and object tracking for real-time applications.]
                   ---[Lee BH, Choi I, Jeon GJ (2006) Motion-based moving object tracking using an active contour.]
                  }
                                    part-based & shape control based method;
                  {
                  Part based methods
                  detect the salient points from the objects and then decompose object into a combination of salient points(主要点的结合) ---[Chen M (2010) Long term activity analysis in surveillance video archives]
                  }
                  {
                  Shape control based methods that is highly efficient in tracking objects when occluded and tracking when two objects cross each other.
                  -----[Kim T, Lee S, Paik J (2011) Combined shape and feature-based video analysis and its application to non-rigid object tracking.]
                  }
                                    model-based method;
                  {
                  The most common modeling technique used is the stick figure modeling, also known as the skeleton model.---[Lao W, Han J, deWith PHN (2010) Flexible human behavior analysis framework for video surveillance applications.]
                  }
                                    combinations of these methods;
                  {
                  Hybrid tracking method uses a combination of two or more of these techniques.---[Brox T, Rosenhahn B, Gall J, Cremers D (2010) Combined region and motion-based 3D tracking of rigid and articulated objects.]
                  }
              }
        Tracking a particular person from a crowd or tracking a particular vehicle in a highly populated transit scene is difficult since the objects in background are similar to the object being tracked. Unique co-ordinates can be calculated from the contour, and if the number of coordinates drastically increases or decreases, occlusion is predicted.

        A simple motion tracking algorithm tracks the displacement of a human. Trajectories can be calculated from the displacement of the object’s centre of his/her foot ---[Yoshimitsu Y, Naito T, Fujimura K, Kamijo S (2010) Behavior understanding at railway station by association of locational semantics and postures. ]
        Motion tracking in an advanced level {
                            finding out the current pose by body pose modeling,
                            occlusion handling ,
                            estimating the trajectories.
        }
        Applications which require recognition of simple poses, can just estimate the position of head, hands and legs to form a basic skeleton of the human (Lao et al. 2010). 2D modeling (Lao et al. 2010) is sufficient for this method. ---[Lao W, Han J, deWith PHN (2010) Flexible human behavior analysis framework for video surveillance applications.]
        For complex applications, along with head, hands and legs, the joints (like ankles, knees) and neck can be identified. This requires 3D modeling (Brown and Capson 2011) for representation.  ---[Brown JA, Capson DW (2011) A framework for 3D model-based visual tracking using a GPU-accelerated particle filter.]
        For vehicles, the shape of vehicles can be used to handle occlusion. The shape of the vehicle can be used to regenerate (Feris et al. 2011) the missing parts of the vehicle.---[Feris R, Petterson J, Siddiquie B, Brown L, Pankanti S (2011) Large-scale vehicle detection in challenging Urban surveillance environments.]
3. High-level Processing Techniques
        The mainly difference of the low-level and high-level technique is the help of the semantic.
        The high-level techniques which is the last step of the infers annotations from video sequences.
    3.1 Pre-processing
        Pre-processing needs to avoid the false recognition of activities and detect correctly.  In phases like object classification, pose recognition and activity recognition, semantics are used to increase accuracy and predict activities that may happen in future ,in phases like {
                object classification,
                pose recognition
                and activity recognition,
        }.
        Semantics can be included even at the tracking phase by including occlusion handling module and body part modeling relevant to the domain.
    3.2 Human behavior recognition and analysis.
        Actions may be POSEs or EVENTs.
        The categorization of the activities list:
        The simplest classification is normal & abnormal ---[Kiryati N, Riklin TR, Ivanchenko Y, Rochel S (2008) Real-time abnormal motion detection in surveillance video. ]
        normal & unusual & abnormal ---[Foroughi H, Yazdi HS, Pourreza H, Javidi M (2008) An eigenspace-based approach for human fall detection using integrated time motion image and multi-class support vector machine.]
        positive & neutral & negative activities ---[Park S, Aggarwal JK (2004) Semantic-level understanding of human actions and interactions using event hierarchy.]
        symmetric & asymmetric activities ---[Lin W, Sun M-T, Poovendran R, Zhang Z (2010) Group event detection with a varying number of group members for video surveillance.]
        recognizes three person activity by analysing two person activities.---[Lao W, Han J, deWith PHN (2010) Flexible human behavior analysis framework for video surveillance applications.]
